# Enclosure Design
Included in this directory are STLs and editable CAD (STEP) files for an enclosure and lid for the PCB design in this repo.  The lid has an opening for a 1.3" OLED display, and for LEDs for power and three output channels.  The back panel has connections for power, three output channels, and temperature sensors for those three channels.  The ambient temperature/humidity sensor (I'm using a [AM2301 module](https://www.ebay.com/itm/191464821805), compatible with the DHT21) mounts to the right side of the enclosure using a M3 screw, and the wires feed through the slot in that side.  The lid fastens with M3 screws, and recesses on the bottom are for M3 heat-set inserts, which I used to fasten the enclosure to a Vixen dovetail clamp.

This design calls for GX12-2 and GX12-3 connectors for power and the temperature sensors, and RCA connectors for the heat bands themselves.

I printed this in PLA with 0.2 mm layer height with Cura's standard settings (two walls, 20% infill).  Filament and print settings are at your discretion; this piece shouldn't call for much in the way of strucural integrity.
